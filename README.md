Automatic opinion lexicon expansion from Twitter

This project consistis of a  supervised method for opinion lexicon expansion in the context of Twitter messages.
The method creates a lexicon with disambiguated POS entries and a probability distribution for positive, negative, and neutral classes. 
It requires a collection of automatic labelled tweets and a seed lexicon of words labelled to classes: positive, negative, and neutral.
